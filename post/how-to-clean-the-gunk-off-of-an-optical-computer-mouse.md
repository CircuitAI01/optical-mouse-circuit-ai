Follow these effective techniques to keep your device performing at its best.</p>
<h3>Gather Your Supplies</h3>
<p>Before starting, it’s important to gather all the necessary supplies. Here’s what you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microfiber cloth</li>
  <li>Isopropyl alcohol (preferably 70% or higher)</li>
  <li>Cotton swabs</li>
  <li>A can of compressed air</li>
  <li>Warm water</li>
  <li>Gentle dish soap</li>

<h3>Unplug Your Mouse</h3>
<p>Safety first! Always unplug your optical computer mouse before cleaning. This helps prevent any accidental clicks or movements while you clean. If you’re using a wireless mouse, remove the batteries to ensure it’s completely powered down.</p>

<p>To start, take your microfiber cloth and dampen it slightly with a mixture of warm water and a few drops of gentle dish soap. Wipe down the entire exterior of the mouse, focusing on areas where grime tends to build up, such as the sides and bottom. Ensure the cloth is damp, not dripping wet, to avoid moisture entering any openings.</p>
<h3>Spot Cleaning with Isopropyl Alcohol</h3>
<p>If there are sticky spots or stubborn gunk, take a cotton swab and dip it into isopropyl alcohol. Gently scrub the affected areas. The alcohol helps to break down grease while evaporating quickly, reducing the risk of moisture entering the device.</p>

<p>The optical sensor is crucial for your mouse's functionality. Ensure you’re extra careful while cleaning this area. Use a dry cotton swab to remove any dust or dirt from around the sensor without applying excessive pressure. This will help in maintaining the tracking accuracy of your mouse.</p>
<h3>Compressed Air for Hard-to-Reach Areas</h3>
<p>Sometimes, gunk can get trapped in small crevices or the scroll wheel mechanism. A can of compressed air is perfect for blowing out dust and debris. Hold the can upright and use short bursts of air to blow away any particles lodged in the mouse.</p>

<h3>Reassemble and Test</h3>
<p>Once you’ve finished cleaning, reassemble your mouse by replacing the batteries if applicable. Plug it back in or reconnect it wirelessly. Move the mouse around on your surface to check if it glides smoothly. If you notice any issues, you may need to repeat some of the previous cleaning steps.</p>
